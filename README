Think of a name for your app, now think of that name when you see the word 'myapp'

GET /myapp returns green or red or yellow
PUT /myapp?status=green sets status green
PUT /myapp?status=yellow sets status yellow
PUT /myapp?status=red sets status red
POST /myapp creates an app if there is none (put does this too)
DELETE /myapp deletes an app

Need a frontend?
GET /myapp/front returns a pretty little javascript to keep you updated on your apps status
                
Usage Hints!
=================

add this to your .autotest file, for perpetual greenosity

    require 'rest_client'                                                                                

    @appname = 'myapp'

    Autotest.add_hook :red do
      RestClient.put "http://stoplightapp.heroku.com/#{@appname}", :status => 'red'
    end

    Autotest.add_hook :green do
      RestClient.put "http://stoplightapp.heroku.com/#{@appname}", :status => 'green'
    end
