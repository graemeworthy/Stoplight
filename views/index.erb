Think of a name for your app, now think of that name when you see the word 'myapp'

GET /myapp returns green or red or yellow
PUT /myapp?status=green sets status green
PUT /myapp?status=yellow sets status yellow
PUT /myapp?status=red sets status red
POST /myapp creates an app if there is none (put does this too)
DELETE /myapp deletes an app

GET /myapp/front returns a pretty little javascript to keep you updated on your app's status

Features: 
Ultra-volatile datastore, resets whenever i deploy a new one, or heroku kills my instances.
Who cares, this is about what's going on right now.. any old messages are yesterdays news.
