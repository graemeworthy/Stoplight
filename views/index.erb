Think of a name for your app, now think of that name when you see the word 'myapp'

GET /myapp returns green or red or nil
PUT /myapp?status=green sets status green
PUT /myapp?status=yellow sets status red
PUT /myapp?status=red sets status red
POST /myapp creates an app if there is none (put does this too)
DELETE /myapp deletes an app

GET /myapp/front returns a pretty little javascript to keep you updated on your app's status
