Need 'security'?

POST /myapp?secret=something makes a stoplight _only you_ can change the colour of.. untill the app resets( which it does at random)
PUT  /myapp?status=green 403 access denied!
PUT  /myapp?status=green&secret=something updates the status
PUT  /myapp?status=green&secret=somethingelse access denied!
DELETE /myapp 403 access denied
DELETE /myapp?secret=something 200 done deal!

How to tell if the server has reset, or you've been snaked

if you use a secret on something created without a secret, 410 GONE because this is not your resource
if you use a secret on something with a different secret, 403 forbidden you've been snaked
